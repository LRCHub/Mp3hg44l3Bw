Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
(Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp)

Let it roll across the floor
Through the hall and out the door
To the Fountain of Perpetual Mirth
Let it roll for all it's worth

Now let it roll
(Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp)

Find me where ye echo lays
Lose ye bodies in the maze
Leper's squint, abode of prancing steed
Now let it roll among the weeds

Now let it roll
(Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp)

Let it roll down through the caves
Ye long walks of Coole and Shades
Through ye woodе, here may ye rеst awhile
Cool retreats will make you smile

Now let it roll
(Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp)

Fools' illusions everywhere
Gobbling friars at your stair
Even though it is such a harrowing sight
Now let it roll into the night

Now let it roll
(Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp
Oh, Sir Frankie Crisp)
