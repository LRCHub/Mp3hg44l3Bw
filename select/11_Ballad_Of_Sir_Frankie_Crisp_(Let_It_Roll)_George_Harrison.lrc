[00:21.77] Let it roll across the floor
[00:27.14] Through the hall and out the door
[00:33.46] To the fountain of perpetual mirth
[00:37.95] Let it roll for all it's worth
[00:52.95] 
[01:05.34] Find me where ye echo lays
[01:09.80] Lose ye bodies in the maze
[01:15.86] See the lord and all the mouths he feeds
[01:21.31] Let it roll among the weeds
[01:25.27] Let it roll
[01:30.77] 
[01:50.53] Let it roll down through the caves
[01:55.98] Ye long walks of Coole and Shades
[02:01.61] Through ye woode, here may ye rest awhile
[02:06.14] Handkerchiefs to match your tie
[02:10.63] Let it roll
[02:16.13] 
[02:22.11] Let it roll
[02:23.96] Let it roll
[02:26.66] Let it roll
[02:29.35] Let it roll
[02:34.85] 
[02:32.92] Fools, illusions everywhere
[02:38.17] Joan and Molly sweeps the stair
[02:44.42] Eyes that shining full of inner light
[02:49.89] Let it roll into the night
[03:02.89] 
[03:22.43] Let it roll
[03:25.22] Let it roll
[03:27.97] Let it roll
[03:30.69] Let it roll
[03:33.30] Let it roll
[03:36.01] Let it roll.
