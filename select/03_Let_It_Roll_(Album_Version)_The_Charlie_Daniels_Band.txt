When I was a boy on my daddys knee
Thats when he said these words to me,
Said listen to what I'm gonna tell you son,
And you can help the world go round.
Dont climb no mountain cause you might slip,
And i know you'll drown if saving ships,
Heres a gutair all shiny and red,
And it makes a magic sound.

Roll, roll, let it roll,
Let it flood down to your soul,
Let it talk, let it swing,
Play that music, let it ring.

Now you can pick buddy holly,
Chuck berry to, and you can do anything that you wanna do,
Wont cause no harm, and never started no wars,
And it sounds like father rain.
They can call it county, they can call it rock,
But I'll play this supper till the day I drop,
If you got any troubles just tune on in
Cause it'll ease away your pain.

Roll, roll, let it roll,
Let it flood down to your soul,
Let it talk, let it swing,
Play that music, let it ring.

Some folks get them college degrees,
And then they open up an office
And they charge big fees,
I never was good for much at all,
Except for playin kinda loud.
I could feel it in my feet, hear it in my head,
I even played that music when I'm laying in bed,
It never did get me anywhere at all, but it makes me kinda proud.

Roll, roll, let it roll,
Let it flood down to your soul,
Let it talk, let it swing,
Play that music, let it ring.

Come on and roll, roll, let it roll,
Let it flood down to your soul,
Let it talk, let it swing,
